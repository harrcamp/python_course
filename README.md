This repository is for all files related to and created from the work done by Harrison Campbell through a book call "Python Crash Course."

Over the course of 20 weeks I will be working through 1 chapter of the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. At the end of each week I will reward myself with a pre-determined endulgence. The reward for completing a chapter each week is not so large as to make the accomplishment of finishing seem over-stated. However the reward should be large enough to encourage continuance.

As of this moment I have just completed Ch3 and will be having pasta for dinner at my favorite pasta bar in Chicago. I'm really excited for this. 

Forward always. Always forward. 

I received the book as a gift in 2019 from my brother Jake, credit to him for the gift.
